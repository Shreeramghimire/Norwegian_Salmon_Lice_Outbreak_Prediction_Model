# Norwegian_Salmon_Lice_Outbreak_Prediction_Model

A comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling framework for sea lice outbreaks in Norwegian salmon farms, incorporating recurrence patterns, temperature synchrony, latitudinal zonation, and machine learning predictions.

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes 10 years of sea lice monitoring data (2015-2025) from Norwegian salmon farms to:
- Identify recurrent outbreak patterns
- Analyze temperature-lice synchrony
- Develop latitudinal zone-specific strategies
- Build predictive models for 2026-2030 outbreaks
- Create management calendars for farms

##  Key Features

- **Recurrence Analysis**: Identify predictable outbreak patterns across years
- **Temperature Synchrony**: Analyze temperature-outbreak relationships
- **Latitudinal Zonation**: 5-zone analysis from Southern to Arctic regions
- **Vulnerability Modeling**: ML models predicting outbreak risk
- **Predictive Calendar**: Weekly forecasts for 2026-2030
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Maps, charts, and management tools

##  Analysis Steps

Data Exploration: Initial data cleaning and exploration
Recurrence Patterns: Identify predictable outbreak weeks
Temperature Analysis: Sea temperature patterns and trends
Synchrony Analysis: Temperature-lice outbreak relationships
Latitudinal Zonation: Zone-based analysis (5 zones)
Environmental Drivers: Temperature optima and photoperiod effects
Vulnerability Modeling: ML models for risk prediction
Predictive Calendar: 2026-2030 outbreak forecasts
Final Analysis: Comprehensive results and recommendations

##  Technologies Used

Data Analysis: pandas, numpy, scipy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, folium
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, xgboost
Geospatial: geopandas, folium
Workflow: jupyter, papermill

##  Key Results

Identified recurrent outbreak patterns in 65% of localities
Found strong temperature synchrony in Southern zones
Developed zone-specific management strategies
Achieved 85% accuracy in vulnerability predictions
Generated predictive calendars for 2026-2030
